# Base Token Tracker

Base Token Tracker is a specialized monitoring platform that tracks newly deployed tokens on the Base network with active trading pairs. Unlike typical token trackers, this platform implements strict filtering mechanisms to help identify legitimate trading activity.

## Purpose

This platform serves as a monitoring tool for tracking new tokens on Base, with several key features designed to filter out potential scams and highlight legitimate trading activity:

- Only displays tokens that have established trading pairs with real liquidity
- Implements a 2-hour recency filter to focus on current market activity
- Excludes tokens with suspicious naming patterns or characteristics
- Requires minimum liquidity thresholds for listing
- Monitors trading patterns to detect unusual activity

## Security Features

The platform includes multiple layers of protection:

1. **Trading Pair Validation**
   - Only tokens with verified trading pairs are displayed
   - Minimum liquidity requirements must be met
   - Trading history must show legitimate market activity

2. **Scam Prevention**
   - Automatic filtering of suspicious token names and symbols
   - Detection of common scam patterns
   - Monitoring of unusual trading behavior
   - Exclusion of tokens without proper contract verification

3. **Data Verification**
   - Cross-reference data from multiple sources
   - Real-time monitoring of trading activity
   - Verification of contract interactions
   - Tracking of liquidity changes

## Token Information

For each legitimate token, the platform displays:

- Current price in USD
- Market capitalization
- Trading volume (24h)
- Buy/Sell transaction counts
- Price changes (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h)
- Liquidity metrics
- Contract creation time
- Trading pair details

## Important Notice

This platform is a **monitoring tool**, not meant to be self-hosted. It includes proprietary filtering mechanisms and security features that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the displayed information. These features cannot be replicated in a self-hosted environment without compromising the security measures in place.
